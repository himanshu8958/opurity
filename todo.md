# June 3
1. re-read related papers
2. write related work section
3. Write op approaches
4. work on examples
5. intro :
   * move to front heruristic
   * Ignore side effects such as memory usage and power consumption
   * OP code often occurs in libraries that are highly optimized.
6. cool quote :
   * Mathematicall, formal verification is easiest when specifications
   are simple and direct, and thud do not involve feedback between the
   meaning of the specification and the program being specified -
   David R cok ( Extensions of the theory of OP ...)
   * the above mentioned paper uses the terms opure and opurity, can
   we use the same terms?
7. read cok paper		(done)
8. talk about why F(2) *3 instead of F(3).

# Oct 13

Examples:
1. levenshteinDistance
   figure out how to use strings in boogie
2. lcs
3. viterbi algorithm

include more examples in paper, illustrate both approaches
ensure every thing has mathit

1. Naumans'work
	how is it different
	compare the techniqure
2. first compare on what do they solve
3. all comparisons should be contained
   What : the problem they solve
   How  : the technique

General
1. 'program components'
2. \textit{formulae}
3. talk about level of automation
