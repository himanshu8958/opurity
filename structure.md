## Flow
1.  Intro
	* P1
		1. how is the property relavant?
		2. current state of the art. (what do they do)
		3. say it is undecidable. we do a tradeoff
	* P2
		1. what we do? (sound static analysis)
		2. what does this paper demonstrate

	* P last
		1. paper organization
		2. proofs in Appendix

	* p2
2. Background

# Formal Verificiation of Piece-Wise Linear Feed-Forward Neural Networks - Ehlers
##Flow

1. Intro
	* Many tasks in computing are prohibitively difficult to
          formalize and thus hard to get right.\newline
	Defining a notion of correctness for a single program,
	requires deep understanding of the program itself. Instead, we
	focused on defining a property that is applicable to a large
	set of programs. The property is designes such, if it does not
	hold; the program is definately incorrect.

# Checking Observational purity by Himanshu
## Intro
* Talk about OPness as a general correctness property
* Explain OPness
* Global variables, as without them; every proc is OP
* Need for an invariant, why global reachable state is needed
* Inv can take into account that foo is OP, building an abstract inv
      1. Inv generation easier, automatable
      2. Inv generation possible. ( non executable path)
* Talk about termination of the given procedure. how that is circumvented.
