## Flow
1.  Intro
	* P1
		1. how is the property relavant?
		2. current state of the art. (what do they do)
		3. say it is undecidable. we do a tradeoff

# Formal Verificiation of Piece-Wise Linear Feed-Forward Neural Networks - Ehlers
##Flow

1. Intro
	* Many tasks in computing are prohibitively difficult to formalize and thus hard to get right.
	Defining a notion of correctness for a single program, requires deep understanding of the program itself. Instead, we focused on defining a property that is applicable to a large set of programs. The property is designes such, if it does not hold; the program is definately incorrect.
